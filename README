About this package
========================

This package is tantatively named E-Cell Particle Dynamics Prototype
(EPDP).  It currently implements the enhanced Greens Function Reaction
Dynamics (eGFRD) and brute-force Brownian Dynamics (BD) simulation
algorithms.  Implementation of the original version of GFRD will possibly
be added in future.  The code is implemented with the hope that it will
eventually be ported to the E-Cell System Version 4 to become part of
the multi-algorithm, multi-space simulation platform.

The eGFRD algorithm is used and described in the following paper:
K. Takahashi, S. Tanase-Nicola, P.R. ten Wolde, 2009 (in preparation).

History of the Code
========================

Koichi Takahashi initially stated development of the code in 2005 to
implement his prototype of Greens Function Reaction Dynamics
simulation method invented by Jeroen van Zon and Pieter Rein ten Wolde
in AMOLF, Amsterdam[1,2].  He gave a brief invited talk about
performance evaluation and applicability of the method to yeast
pheromon response pathway (the Alpha pathway) using the prototype in
Third Annual Alpha Project Research Symposium (June 16-27, 2005, at UC
Berkeley Art Museum).

Later, in December 2006, ten Wolde, Sorin Tanase-Nicola, and Takahashi
decided to introduce the concept called first-passage processes
inspired by a paper by Opplestrup et al.[3] to Greens Function
Reaction Dynamics to further boost the performance and accuracy of the
method.  The new method was called eGFRD (enhanced Greens Function
Reaction Dynamics).  Takahashi implemented the single-body Greens
function within the year.  Tanase-Nicola derived the two-body Greens
function, and Takahashi devised and implemented a neat yet complicated
way to efficiently evaluate the function mostly in the first half of
2007.  Takahashi also implemented the main part of the code,
asynchronous discrete-event-driven kinetic monte-carlo, which has been
mostly finished within 2007, and the dynamic switching between Greens
function and brute-force Brownian Dynamics as a means to recover from
particle squeezing conditions by April 2008.  At this point,
development and debugging of the initial version (version 0.1) of the
code had been largely finished and had been used in simulation experiments
in study of various biochemical systems including dual-phosphorylation
pathways[4].

Some features planned to be added are; surfaces, interactions between
membrane proteins and proteins in solution, optimistic discrete-event
scheduling for massive parallelization, connection to non-spatial 
simulation methods such as ODE and Gillespie methods.
