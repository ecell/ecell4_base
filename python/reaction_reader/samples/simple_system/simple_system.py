## simple_system.bngl
##
## An example model for running NFsim to get you started.
##
## Comments in BNGL are always preceded with a pound (#) character, so that any text that
## follows a pound character is ignored.  The model file below is commented to help you
## understand the main parts of a BNGL file.  Note that some commands at the end of the
## model file that allow you to run the model with different simulators are commented out.
## To use these other options, simply remove the pound character before the command.
#
#begin model
#
## The first part of a BNGL file is the parameters block, where you can define the rates
## of equations or the starting numbers of any of the molecular species.
#begin parameters
#    kon 10
#    koff 5
#    kcat 0.7
#    dephos 0.5
#end parameters
#
#
## Next, we define the set of molecule types in the system.  This is a declaration only, so
## we don't specify how many of each molecules there are, and we have to provide a list
## of all possible state values for each component of each molecule with a tilda (~)
## character.
#begin molecule types
#    X(y,p~0~1)
#    Y(x)
#end molecule types
#
#
## Here is where we declare the starting molecules in our simulation.  Each component
## must be assigned a single state value, and we have to provide how many of each
## molecule exists in the system.  The number of starting molecules can also be
## specified with one of the parameters defined earlier
#begin species
#    X(y,p~0)   5000
#    X(y,p~1)   0
#    Y(x)       500
#end species
#
#
## Observables allow us to define simulation output.  Here we have declared a number
## of Molecules observables with the given name and pattern.  If you look at the output
## gdat files that are generated from simulations of this model, you will see that they
## each have a count for every simulation time.
#begin observables
#    Molecules    X_free          X(p~0,y)
#    Molecules    X_p_total       X(p~1)
#    Molecules    Xp_free         X(p~1,y)
#    Molecules    XY              X(y!1).Y(x!1)
#    Molecules    Ytotal          Y()
#    Molecules    Xtotal          X()
#end observables
#
#
## This model does not require any user-defined functions, but you would
## declare them here if you needed to.  See the user manual for help with
## declaring your own functions.
#begin functions
#
#end functions
#
#
## This is a very simple system indeed.  The only rules that are defined
## tell us that X can bind Y if X is dephosphorylated.  Then the XY complex
## can either disassociate, or a phosphorylation reaction can occur.  Finally, X
## will dephosphorylate regardless of whether or not it is bound to Y, although
## for these rules, it will always be unbound to Y if it is phosphorylated.
## Here are the rule definitions:
#begin reaction rules
#    X(y,p~0) + Y(x) -> X(y!1,p~0).Y(x!1)   kon
#    X(y!1,p~0).Y(x!1) -> X(y,p~0) + Y(x)   koff
#    X(y!1,p~0).Y(x!1) -> X(y,p~1) + Y(x)   kcat
#
#    X(p~1) -> X(p~0)                       dephos
#end reaction rules
#
#end model
#
## COMMAND FOR RUNNING OR PROCESSING THIS BNGL FILE
#
## Now we can run NFsim directly from BioNetGen using the simulate_nf command, where
## "t_end" is the simulation time, "n_steps" is the number of steps, and "suffix" is
## the filename ending of this run.  The suffix allows us to run the same model
## multiple times here, and distinguish between all the runs with different "suffix"s.
## Note that this step will also automatically create an NFsim readable XML model
## specification file.
# 
## simulate_nf({t_end=>100,n_steps=>50});
#
## We can also use the keyword "param" to pass any command line arguments to NFsim
## that we want.  As an example, we can rerun the model with the verbose (-v) option
## and the universal traversal limit (-utl) option.  See the manual for a description
## of Universal Traversal Limits, and other command line arguments.
#
## simulate_nf({suffix=>nfVerbose,t_end=>100,n_steps=>50,param=>"-v -utl 3"});
#
## If we want to run NFsim directly from the console, and ignore BioNetGen altogether
## after the BNGL file has been processed, we need to include the "writeXML" command.
## This will write out your model to "simple_system.xml".  In general, the XML file
## name will match the BNGL file name, with an XML extension instead of .bngl.
#
#writeXML()
#
## If you uncomment and use this command here, then you can run NFsim directly by
## calling the NFsim_[version] executable from the command-line, where [version] is
## the NFsim version that matches your operating system.  See the user manual for more
## help.
#
## Finally, if we want to simulate this model with ordinary differential equations (ODEs)
## of with Gillespie's stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) in BioNetGen, we have
## to first generate the reaction network with the following command.  The overwrite
## option (which you can remove) is set to 1 here so that every time this is run, the
## reaction network output file will be regenerated.
#
#generate_network({overwrite=>1})
#
## Then we can call the simulate_ode or simulate_ssa methods to run the model file.  Again,
## the suffix parameter is used to name the output of the simulations.  Note also that
## between BioNetGen ODE and SSA simulation commands, we have to reset the molecule concentrations.
## this is needed because BioNetGen allows you to restart a simulation from the end of
## a previous simulation.  While this does not apply to NFsim, you can still change parameters 
## mid-simulation by using an RNF script (see example.rnf file in the same directory as this
## model).
#
#simulate({method=>"ode",t_end=>100,n_steps=>50})
#
## resetConcentrations()
## simulate({method=>"ssa",suffix=>ssa,t_end=>100,n_steps=>50})
#
