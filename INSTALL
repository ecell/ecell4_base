Prerequisites
-------------------------

1. autotools
   (autoconf, automake, libtool)
2. GNU Scientific Library (GSL) 1.11 or later.
3. Boost C++ Library 1.37 or later.
4. Python 2.3 or later.
5. Scipy 0.5 or later, Numpy 1.0 or later.

If you use Fedora or any other RedHat lines of linux, check
if the following RPM packages are installed:

gsl, gsl-devel, numpy, scipy, boost, and boost-devel.

On Ubuntu Linux and some other Debian families, install the following:

gsl-bin, libgsl0, libgsl0-dev, libboost-dev, libboost-date-time-dev,
libboost-python-dev, libboost-regex-dev, libboost-test-dev, python-scipy.


In addition to above, optionally,
6. python-matplotlib if you want to use the plotting scripts in the samples.
7. Pychecker if you want to run 'make pycheck'.


A note on GSL version
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

GSL version 1.10 and earlier has at least two bugs that can cause abnormal
program exits when a Bessel function is evaluated with specific argument
values.  These bugs can hit stability of this software.
For this reason, use of GSL version 1.11 or later is recommended.


Building this package
-------------------------

1. ./configure
2. make


If you cannot find the configure script, or the build process
fails to complete even if you have set up the environment correctly,
try

./autogen.sh

to remake the entire build mechanism.


Testing
-------------------

% make check

checks if some of the core components of the software run correctly.

In addition, you may run

% make pycheck

if you want to be super-strict about Python syntax.


Running
-------------------------

Go to subdirectories under doc/samples, and read README files 
included about how to run the samples.
